The GearShed is a community led, peer-to-peer marketplace where you can rent other people’s outdoor equipment for short periods of time. We make it easy to connect weekend warriors with people that have spare or unused gear. 

**Looking for some equipment for your next adventure?** Why spend hundred of pounds buying a kayak to use it only once or twice a year when you could borrow for just the weekend?

**Already got tonnes of gear but it’s gathering dust in the shed?** How about getting that unloved tent to earn you cash while helping others get outdoors?

The GearShed connects you with climbers, walkers, snowboarders and many other outdoor enthusiasts that have spare capacity. You can borrow tents, water sports gear, ice axes and skis for your next holiday or just for the day. 

It’s simple to sign up and start borrowing. Log in, search for gear near you, rent, have a blast and then return. We charge a flat fee for rentals and offer a safe and secure system for payment. User profiles let you review the gear you want and gives you confidence in what you’re borrowing. 

The GearShed offers an environmentally conscious alternative to buying new equipment and saves on consumerism. We help the earth by keeping unloved gear out of landfill and save you cash by renting and not buying.

If you’d like to know more about the sharing economy check out our micro-blog or follow us on twitter. 

If you’ve got a spare piece of gear and would like to offer it to the community, why not sign up and list your item. It only takes a second and you can rest assured your gear is covered by our secure deposit scheme so you always get your equipment back in the same state that you lent it out.
