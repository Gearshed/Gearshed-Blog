When someone mentions winter sports people immediately jump to mainland Europe, the Alps, the Dolomites, the Pyrenees. However, we have access to amazing areas just in our backyard!

Most people if asked would say that Scotland is the capital of the UK winter sports scene and with good reason, with so many activities on offer, the ruggedness of the Cairngorms, Grampians and Cullins to name but a few and generally reliable snowfall (compared to other parts of the UK) it does come out trumps. However, when the snow is good, there are equally as good climbs and adventures to be had in the Lake District, Wales and if you're really lucky the Peak District too!  

So, with these large areas of UK national park what is there to do? 

For those of you interested in alpine-downhill skiing the Cairngorm's, Glencoe, Glanshee, the Nevis Range and the Lecht in Scotland offer a vast array of skiing with button and chair lifts, an ideal get away for your weekend! There is also a button lift on Helvelyn offering 9 un-pisted runs. 

Ski touring all across the Lake District, Wales and Scotland is becoming ever more popular, especially if you want to cover more of the great outdoors, especially when compared to winter walking or snowshoeing. 

Ice climbing and winter mountaineering have become more accessible with lighter, stronger and warmer gear (which you can hire from GearShed) to send even the most harrowing of winter lines. Scottish winter climbing is unique with its own set of quirky rules and ethics with some of the best winter climbers from around the world coming to experience what Scotland, the Lake District and Wales has to offer.

Winter walking across the UK national parks is relatively easy to get into with comparatively few new skills to be learnt, all your equipment like walking axes boots and crampons can be hired from GearShed, making it even easier to have an adventure of your own!

If you're looking to get involved in any of the sports or activities there are loads of great places you can learn in a fun and safe environment. Clubs all around the British Isles regularly participate and introduce new climbers, hill walkers and skiers in winter skills and all of the outdoor pursuit centres in the UK offer courses throughout the winter; Plasy Brenin and Glen More Mountain Lodge to name just two. 

Take the opportunity this winter to get out there and share the outdoors!

If you are heading out into the hills remember to take care and look at the forecast and avalanche safety information:
