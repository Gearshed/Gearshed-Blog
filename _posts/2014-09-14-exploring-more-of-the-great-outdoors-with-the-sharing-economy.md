At GearShed we want to get more people into the great outdoors, especially those that wouldn’t normally get the chance. Whether you live in inner city London, are setting out on your first DofE challenge or are a seasoned mountaineer there are so many different ways to experience our countryside utilising the tools of the sharing economy. 

The UK is a great place to explore because it has so many different types of landscape from high mountains, lakes, rivers, rolling hills, cliffs, miles of coastline, caves to beaches. What’s more there are hundreds of new sports you can try in each of these places. So we’re here to give you some ideas and let you know innovative ways we can help you explore the outdoors. Here’s a few ideas to try.

###Rent a tent and have a micro adventure

You don’t need to live in the Lake District to have amazing outward bound adventures. Why not try renting a tent and taking it to the highest point in your county and have a go at wild camping. You can have a go at some campfire cooking plus connecting with nature in the outdoors is a great way to unwind.  For added points go straight from work and find somewhere along your commute home for a 5-9 adventure.


###Liven up a date

Already exhausted the cinema option? How about renting a paddleboard or kayak and taking your date on a trip to your local river? It’s a guaranteed adventure and not something they’ll easily forget. Plus there’s nothing like relaxing on the water to get the conversation flowing. For extra points don’t forget to take a romantic picnic. 


###Get fit without a gym

Bored of the same sweaty gym? Borrow a bike and try out your local mountain bike trails. You can even rent a GoPro and film your epic adventure for some mid-week motivation when you get back. The UK has some of the best trails in Europe and most are easily accessible within a few hours drive from anywhere in the country. Search you’re local area for mountain bikes and you’ll no doubt get loads of friendly advice on where to start out. And if transporting a bike to the nearest trails is a problem you can always search around the trails for local businesses willing to lend .

###Make you colleagues jealous of your weekend 

Fed up of telling your all your work mates ‘nothing much, this weekend spent it with the in-laws again’. Wouldn’t you prefer ‘rented some gear and learnt how to ski in Aviemore’? Don’t settle for boring. Nuff said.  


###Take your group somewhere different

If you are in charge of finding an activity for a group, whether a hen party or a kids club, taking them into the hills or kayaking on a lake can be a great a way to form bonds and will be something a little different from the norm. If you’re looking for a big group, search for local businesses. They’ll be more than happy to lend and you might even give you a discounted rate. 


###Don’t forget your holiday essentials

Going on a skiing holiday in Val d'Isere or planning some via ferrata in the dolomites? You can rent the essential gear you need for your trip and even things you might not have thought of. Ski jackets, hiking poles, handheld GPS and rucksacks are just some of the essentials you can rent on GearShed
