Whether you live in inner city London, are setting out on your first DofE challenge or are a seasoned mountaineer there are so many different ways to experience our countryside utilising the tools of the sharing economy.

At GearShed we love exploring the outdoors. We set up this site with the idea of creating the biggest community of like-minded outdoor lovers in the UK.  A community that helps each other get into the outdoors and share stories of their adventures to inspire others. 

To help people share the outdoors we rely on all the folks willing to list their own gear. We’ve put together what we think are some excellent reasons for you to join us and feel at ease while you’re doing it.

Individuals and even businesses that list their gear on our site have access to a huge audience of potential borrowers, across the UK and Europe, who can search our site by location, date, item or activity. We make it easy for equipment hire businesses to earn cash by listing their extra stock on our site or for individuals to earn some revenue on their unused equipment that’s sitting around at home.

It’s always free to list your gear and you only even pay a fee (10%) if your item is successfully lent out. We let you list as many items as you like and give you complete flexibility around how much time you make the item available for.  

You can list all sorts of items, whatever your interest there is always someone willing to borrow your gear. 

You can list surfboards & paddleboards, hiking & camping equipment, mountaineering hardware, skis & snowboards, kayaks & canoes, GPS devices & action sports cameras, technical clothing, fishing gear, wetsuits, bikes and much more.

You have the freedom and flexibility to: 

* List as many items as you want

* Earn reviews and build a reputation on your profile

* Manage when you want to lend and when you don’t

* Accept or decline anyone 

* Get paid safely and securely

* Include a lesson as part of your gear hire agreement 

We have a unique deposit scheme where you specify the replacement cost of your item, which ensures you’re totally covered should anything happen to your gear.

So if you’ve got spare equipment that you’re not using right now, why not earn some cash and list it on our site. You might even help someone get into the outdoors that wouldn’t usually have the chance.
