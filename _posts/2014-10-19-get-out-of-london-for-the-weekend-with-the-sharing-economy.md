Sure, London has some of the world’s best restaurants and bars but when it comes to getting into the great outdoors it can leave you feeling a little cut off. 

But it doesn’t have to be that way. We’re putting together a series of tips and guides so you can go to get out of London for the weekend or even the day and experience some of our great British countryside. 

The sharing economy is opening up the way we travel with companies like AirBnB making short term travel cheap and convenient by letting homeowners rent out there spare rooms to traveller online. At GearShed, we’re opening up the world of outdoor sports by connecting people who want to borrow gear with people who have spare gear to lend out. 

##The South Downs – Countryside On London’s Doorstep 

This weeks ‘get out of London’ tip is all about the South Downs. Only 55 miles, or an hour and a half out of central London, the South Downs is the closest spot where you can spend the day hiking or biking in rolling countryside without feeling close to a major city. 

The South Downs benefits from being only a few miles from Brighton, which allows for easily travel down from London by train and great transport links to get into the National Park.

The National Park has some of the most varied and dramatic terrain in the south of the country, full of easy ambles and beauty spots, not to mention some lovely market towns (think Lewes) where you can while away an afternoon.

However, if you’re feeling adventurous our best tip is to hire a bike and spend the day on the South Downs Way. The trail runs from the famous white cliffs in Eastbourne 100 miles west to Winchester, but the trail can be a worthwhile pursuit even if you don’t travel from end to end.

There are plenty of cycle hire companies along the trail and many of them even have camping facilities. Alternatively use our site to find people in the local area with bikes to rent.

Being so long, the trail is varied with some sections little more than a gentle coastal cycle and other that are a bit hillier. Even at only 200 m high, there are some steep hills that can take some time to get to the top, but are well worth the downhill experience. 

If you’re looking for a more family oriented day we recommend www.southdownsway.co.uk where you can find some great walks and cycle routes many of which also feature a pub pit stop mid route.

##For An Added Twist Why Not Try Camping?

Don’t forget, the area is also dotted with campsites and small farms that let you pitch a tent. As well as being one of the cheapest ways to experience the South Downs you get the added bonus of farm fresh food in the morning. 

With all this only a few hours out of central London you can spend the weekend getting back to nature and still be back for work on Monday.
