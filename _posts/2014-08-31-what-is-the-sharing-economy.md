The term "sharing economy" started to be used in the mid-nineties, though until the last couple of years was relatively unheard of. Now people are far more aware of the word sharing economy but may be a bit more confused as to what it actually means and what it can do for you.

The sharing economy or peer to peer (P2P) economy is a system which allows the sharing of physical or human resources. Now, this is a rather loose definition but there are virtually no limits to what you can do in the sharing economy. Users of the peer-to-peer economy can be participants (borrowers), providers (lenders) or both! Things are shared directly from individuals to individuals through an online marketplace, making it easy, fast and inexpensive to connect and share.

One of the largest organisations based on the sharing economy is Airbnb, a company which allows you to rent your house or to rent a house, connecting host and guest directly through their website. Other companies connect car sharers, people with household goods, garden tools, taxis and many, many other things.

The involvement of information technology and online payment has been instrumental in the development of the many companies with sites typically having a rating system for users (whether they be borrowing or lending) indicating previous borrowers and lenders experiences. 

###So what is GearShed?

GearShed is a website which connects the outdoor community. We get people and organisations who want to lend and borrow equipment from the community together, whether that be for a few hours, a weekend or up to a year. Our site is easy to use, straightforward and has no hidden fees or extras! 

###Why should I join the GearShed community?

####Sharing is caring

At GearShed we are conscious about the environment. By borrowing gear it means that you are having a smaller environmental impact than buying it, especially if what you buy sits in the shed for 80% of the time. Less manufacture means a happier, healthier planet.

####Money Money Money

A big advantage is the cost: borrowing gear is a significantly cheaper method of getting into the outdoors than buying it. GearShed makes it easy to try new sports without the daunting prospect of forking out loads of cash for new gear. If you have gear that is unused or willing to be lent then you can make a few pounds by lending it out to our lovely borrowers.

####Try before you buy

If there is a bit of gear you want to "test drive" before you fully commit to buying it you can always look on GearShed, borrow it for the weekend/week/month and see if you really like it before splashing out. 

####There's no "I" in team / Get involved

GearShed is a really good place to meet other active people and inspire you with great trip and adventure ideas. We are creating a community of like minded people who encourage others to try new things and get better at the things they already love doing. From kite boarding to climbing, caving to kayaking, surfing to skiing and everything in-between we are creating a community to share the outdoors.
