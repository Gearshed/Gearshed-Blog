Welcome to The GearShed. We set up this site after an idea sparked on a recent climbing trip. We were planning on going to Portland Bill to do some sport climbing routes when we realised we didn’t have a tent to hand. We phoned around and our friends were all either using theirs too, or away. So that got us thinking, why not have an online platform where we can all search for spare or unused gear to borrow. 

We set this platform up as a side project and it has grown into a marketplace for connecting like-minded adventurers who want to get away for some outdoor fun. We are a community led site where your recommendations and ideas help get people into the outdoors.

The sharing economy is sweeping the world and consumers are starting to realise the benefits of simply borrowing items instead of buying. And instead of unused gear gathering dust in the shed, it is being lent out to weekend warriors and part time climbers, hikers, surfers and snowboarders. 

Our aim for this community is to get more of you involved in the outdoors and we set this blog up to give you ideas of what to try next. Whether you are based in the city and are looking to get to the coast this weekend, or are thinking of renting a surfboard for a week in milder climes, we’ve got the inspiration to get you outdoors and trying new things (Not to mention the gear to make it a reality).  

From our personal experience outdoor enthusiasts are mindful, fun and adventurous people who love to try new things. We want to grow a community that shares more than just gear. If you want to be a part of this community, sign up and try something different and share your experiences. Or lend out your gear and help get others into the great outdoors. Don’t forget, we all respect each other’s gear, treat it as if it was our own and return it on time. Be a part of our site and <a href='#mailing-list' class='mailing-list'>sign up.</a>
