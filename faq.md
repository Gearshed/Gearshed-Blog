###How does GearShed work?

GearShed connects like-minded people who want to lend each other outdoor sports equipment. People who have spare gear to lend can create a profile and start adding equipment listings. If someone wants to borrow your gear we connect you efficiently and then handle payment. 

###How much does it cost?

The cost of renting each individual item is set by the lender (we call them a host) and can be based on an hourly, daily or weekly fee. When a guest wants to borrow the item we take a flat 20% fee from the guest and a 10% fee from the host to cover payment.

###Is my gear safe?

We are working as hard as possible to ensure whenever you lend out your own equipment that it is safe and is given back to you in the state you lent it out. We pride ourselves on a community of like-minded people and we ask you all to follow our simple rules of conduct. We’ve got user profiles that are scored by our community to give you peace of mind when you are a borrowing and we have a unique deposit scheme that is fully transparent so you can see how much you’d need to cover if someone when wrong and you lost the equipment. 

###What if I don’t return the equipment on time?

Oops! You were probably having too much fun and forgot the return your gear on time, that’s ok! You’ll be charged at the daily rate for the equipment you borrowed if it isn’t returned of the specified day. If you’ve borrowed for a week block and you miss the return date you’ll only be charged the day rate for the number of days you borrow. 

###What if my guest doesn’t return my equipment on time?

If you’re guest hasn’t returned your gear on the day specified we will automatically charge for an extra day at the items standard day rate. We’ll also send a reminder email to the guest and prompt them to return as soon as possible or contact you to renegotiate a longer hire period.
However, if that fails and your gear is not returned to you after five days at the standard day rate and there is no response from the guest you have the option of entering into the arbitration process.  

###How does the arbitration process work?

Once you have initiated the arbitration process there is a mandatory 14 day grace period (lets face it, our travel plans don’t always go the way we anticipated) where we wait for a response from the guest and any evidence that they have in fact returned the gear. If after 14 days there is no response from the guest you can claim the deposit held against your item. 

###What happens if my gear is lost, damaged or stolen?

If you are sure your item is lost, damaged or stolen you have the option of initiating the arbitration process straight away where you can specify either the full deposit back or a proportion of the deposit. We’ll email your guest and ask for supporting evidence against your claim. If there is sufficient evidence the item was not returned etc, the deposit you specified will be returned to you. 

###My host didn’t lend me the gear, can I get a refund?

If you turned up at the specified time and place and the gear wasn’t there then you can enter into the full refund process. This will take 7 days and we will contact the host in the meantime. Don’t forget to rate their profile and let other users know your experience. 

###Why do I have to pay a deposit?

If the worse comes to worse and you lose someone’s pride and joy they can claim back the amount they paid for it so they will not lose out.  The deposit scheme is completely transparent and there is a confirmation process to make sure you are happy with the amount before you agree to borrow the gear. We do not actually take the deposit out of your account and in a similar way to when you rent a car, only take a holding amount from your card. 

###What price should I lend my gear out for?

Good question! Well actually that’s up to you. You can search through the site and see what similar items are priced at in your area to give you an idea. We’ve put together this handy page here although we don’t plan on giving exact pound and penny values for you to base your price on. The market for rental gear is in constant flux and we want the market to operate as naturally as possible so the page above only gives you an idea of relative cost/unit of time.
