So you’ve got some gear, and you’re willing to lend it to our community of like-minded adventurers. That’s awesome, thanks for being part of the movement! This page takes you through the sign up and listing process to get you the best deal.

- Sign up <a href='#mailing-list' class='mailing-list'>here</a> and let us know where you’re located.
- Add a tag line and description of your item. Don’t forget to add a photo or two!
- Let us know how long you’re willing to lend the gear out for. 
- Set a price and list.  

When someone wants to borrow your equipment, we send you an email with the length of time and date. Negotiate a pick up time and if you’re both happy accept and get paid. When your weekend warrior arrives to take the gear, check it over together and agree a return time and you’re done! 

You’re protected by our unique deposit system where you set the replacement cost of the equipment. Should your weekend warrior break your pride and joy, you can get your money back no problem. 

The GearShed not only connects you with people willing to pay to borrow your gear, we also help you manage your inventory. Companies or individuals with lots of gear to lend can manage their stock, regardless of whether all the gear was rent out via us. 

We’re still building our site and will be online soon. But if you’re too excited to wait and want to know more info now, <a href='#mailing-list' class='mailing-list'>sign up to our occasional newsletter</a>, add us on facebook or follow us on twitter.
